                    <p>When times get tough, the tough take a stand...or maybe they just bail on life and move to South America. Turns out the latter is quite a good option. After four years of working as a mechanical engineer in Canada, Leith earned his Professional Engineering designation in September of 2010 and proceeded to commemorate the honor by quitting his job and moving to Bolivia for 9 months to be a mountain-bike guide. Similarly, in February of 2011, Jen completed her masters at the University of California, Santa Barbara and thought a trip to South America for a few months would provide exactly the decompression and celebratory adventure she needed. Little did either of them know, the real adventure was just beginning.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes Jen forgets her age and still functions with the “I am invincible” mentality of a child. As is such, March 17, 2011 in La Paz Bolivia, she signed up to take a mountain bike trip down el Camino del Muerte (“The Death Road” also known as “The World’s Most Dangerous Road”) with the Gravity Bolivia Mountain Bike Company. While Jen was waiting at the café in La Paz with the other “I am invincible” patrons for the trip to begin, a young tour-guide finally entered and sauntered to the front of the room. He read 12 names off a list and said, “You all are in my group today. Sucks for the rest of you because you’re stuck with Leith”. Jen wasn’t quite sure what this meant, as her name was not on the first list, but was somewhat comforted when Leith walked into the café a few minutes later and seemed competent. He also wasn’t too hard on the eyes, despite his unruly long locks and terrible jokes (Leith will disagree as to the quality of the latter). Leith outlined the series of events for the day and everyone loaded onto the bus and headed toward the starting point. To keep it short and sweet, the bike ride down the Death Road consisted of Jen crashing and dragging the bike for a portion of the trip, while Leith popped wheelies through waterfalls and jumped over some rivers (no exaggeration. We have video evidence to support this). After an exhausting and somewhat emotionally terrifying day of biking, the tour commenced in Yolosa at the La Senda Verde Animal Refuge, a remarkable ecological reserve for animals rescued from illegal trafficking. Not surprisingly, this is where Jen and Leith had their first real conversation, one that went unexpectedly well given the awkwardness of both parties involved.</p>

                    <p>The drive back up to La Paz proved to be a bit terrifying when the bus driver, unaided by streetlights, veered close to the cliff’s edge. Jen remained tense, nestled deep into her seat at the back of the bus when she heard one of her favorite songs from the band Brand New playing over the bus speakers. Since Leith was the only Gravity Bolivia employee on the bus who could possibly be familiar with this obscure New York band, Jen decided to use it as an excuse to talk to Leith. She very awkwardly walked up to the front of the bus, sat next to Leith, and asked “You know this band??” to which Leith responded, “YOU know this band?!”. The two nerds then geeked out over obscure rock music for the rest of the ride.</p>

                    <p>At the end of the night, Leith asked Jen if she wanted to go out and have a drink. Due to elephantiasis of Jen’s lower limbs from sand fly bites earlier that day, they agreed to forego drinks that night meet up the next day for lunch. Leith treated Jen to a pizza and ice-cream lunch date (what more could a girl ask for?)...and that was all it took for Jen to get hooked.</p>

                    <p>Leith and Jen met up later that night at a local club for a bit, but Jen had to leave early, as the friends she was staying with were ready to go home. Two days later, Jen continued on her South American trip and headed to Buenos Aires. Upon arriving, she sent Leith a message to say hello and received this email response. To say the least, some "weird turn of events" did bring them together and every day since continues to be a pretty amazing adventure.</p>
